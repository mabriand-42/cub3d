# cub3d

This is my first attempt for the cub3d project.
I tried to make my very own calculations using euclidean geometry rather than vectors because it seemed more logical then.
I managed to go until the camera rotation. This task resulted in too many special cases so after a few attempts I decided
to switch for vectors.
